# trackseeker
A tool that uses the Dead Air Removal Service to discover hidden tracks and add them to iTunes.

Often hidden tracks that are ripped from CDs leave the user with a massive file that has the short ending track followed by several minutes of silence and then a short hidden track. Trackseeker removes the silence from these tracks and splits them into two seperate files.
